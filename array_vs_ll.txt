> Array is guaranteed contiguous in memory and LL is not
> Array is O(1) access time and LL is O(n) access time
> Array is index based and LL relies on pointer references between members
> Array is compile time fixed size and LL can grow dynamically at runtime
> Array is slower to insert elements as reshuffling requires more work
> Can binary search an array whereas LL is linear search only
